### Part 1
Start at a location facing North, you are given a input of direcitons that tell you to turn left or right, then walk a certain distance forward. At the end of those instructions, how far away are you from the start.

Example Directions:
```
L1, R2
```
You would end up one square West, and two squares North of where you started.

### Part 2
Follow the same instrutions as in part 1, but the first time you cross your old path, stop and report the distance back to the start.
